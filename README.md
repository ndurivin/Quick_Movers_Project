## Known Bugs
This being a simple web based project, the process was completed without any known bugs.
## Technologies Used
The entire project is built using two major technologies; HTML and CSS. HTML has been used in providing the general structure of the page with CSS being used in the styling aspect. As such, the HTML has more content as compared to the CSS. Considering that only HTML and CSS are used, the landing page is not much responsive, and that will be attained upon additional technologies such as Javascript.
